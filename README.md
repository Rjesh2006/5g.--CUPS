## CUPS ( control and user plane sepration ):-

# *whats the cups ?:-*
**Control and User plane sepration (cups) isnt a new concept int wirless world, its part of 3gpp relese 14 .**


**cups is essential to 5g network becauseits allow operators to seprate the evolved packet core (epc) into a control plane that can sit in a centralized location and for the user plane to be placed closer to the application its supporitng .** 


**This type of sepration key for applictaion such as the connnected car .in that scenario a network operator can place the epc user and therefore reduces the latency**

  ***Here you can see the figure of  cups in 4G- network:--***

  ***5G-- architechture is based SBA and its designed to have Cups concept,as there will be entity for control plane Smf and Amf and Upf for user plane .***


# Benefits of (CUPS) in brief:--
 - **5G - Readlines:- Cisco  Control plane user plane sepration (CUPS) for cisco Ultrs service platform ( usp) prepares the mobile data network for 5G core network will inherit the cups capability as defined in 3gpp release 14 .**
   
 - **Also Cisco defined design of cups for usp is  designed to be aligned with 5G core network architecture at inception to be aligned with 5G core network architeture at inception .**
 
 - **Cisco support SAE _GW_-c and SAE-GW-U which aligns with the 5G core network session management function (SMF)and user plane function (UPf)network functions.**
